        <h1>CHALLENGES</h1>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>Functions can be written in a bunch of different ways and 
        used in an integrated way with many other things in JavaScript. It's so flexible and
        and foundational, that it is complicated. And hard to grasp. </p>
        <h2>Hoisting</h2>
        <p>Hoisting is difficult because it also works differently depending on several factors.
